In this article, we report an analysis of the epidemiologic and clinical aspects of the LF outbreak that occurred in Nigeria during January 1-May 6, 2018. A total of 1,893 cases were reported; 423 were laboratory-confirmed cases, among which 106 deaths were recorded (case-fatality rate 25.1%). Among all confirmed cases, 37 occurred in healthcare workers. The secondary attack rate among 5,001 contacts was 0.56%. Most (80.6%) confirmed cases were reported from 3 states (Edo, Ondo, and Ebonyi). Fatal outcomes were significantly associated with being elderly; no administration of ribavirin; and the presence of a cough, hemorrhaging, and unconsciousness.

Like Ebola virus, Lassa virus (LASV) can cause hemorrhagic fever with high case fatality rates. We generated a genomic catalog of almost 200 LASV sequences from clinical and rodent reservoir samples. We show that whereas the 2013-2015 EVD epidemic is fueled by human-to-human transmissions, LASV infections mainly result from reservoir-to-human infections. We elucidated the spread of LASV across West Africa and show that this migration was accompanied by changes in LASV genome abundance, fatality rates, codon adaptation, and translational efficiency. By investigating intrahost evolution, we found that mutations accumulate in epitopes of viral surface proteins, suggesting selection for immune escape. This catalog will serve as a foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics.

Results showed no strong evidence of a new strain emerging nor of person-to-person transmission; rather, rodent contamination was the main source.

Musa; Hao Fu; Daihai He; Jing Qin,Epidemiology and Infection,2020.0,"Abstract Lassa fever (LF) is increasingly recognised as an important rodent-borne viral haemorrhagic fever presenting a severe public health threat to sub-Saharan West Africa. In 2017–18, LF caused an unprecedented epidemic in Nigeria and the situation was worsening in 2018–19. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number ( R ) and state rainfall. We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the R s and epidemic turning points ( τ ) in different regions at different time periods. Cochran's Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and state rainfall with various lag terms. Our estimated R s for 2017–18 (1.33 with 95% CI 1.29–1.37) was significantly higher than those for 2016–17 (1.23 with 95% CI: (1.22, 1.24)) and 2018–19 (ranged from 1.08 to 1.36). We report spatial heterogeneity in the R s for epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We find that a one-unit (mm) increase in average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months could cause a 0.62% (95% CI 0.20%–1.05%)) rise in R . There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the LF epidemics in different Nigerian regions.

Nuismer,PLoS Computational Biology,2021.0,"Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33657095/,https://openalex.org/W3134426702,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/PMID_33657095.pdf,2026-01-26T01:40:33+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#2620,True

This disease has become endemic in the Lassa belt of Sub-Saharan Africa, thus increasing the health burden in these regions including Nigeria. A deterministic mathematical model is presented to study the dynamics of Lassa fever in Nigeria. The model describes the transmission between two interacting hosts, namely the human and rodent populations. Using the cumulative number of cases reported by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control within the first week of January 2020 through the eleventh week in 2021, we performed the model fitting and parameterization using the nonlinear least square method.

Improved surveillance and testing capacity have revealed in an increased number of reported cases and apparent geographic spread of Lassa fever in Nigeria. We described the recent four-year trend of Lassa fever in Nigeria to improve understanding of its epidemiology and inform the design of appropriate interventions. Methods We analysed the national surveillance data on Lassa fever maintained by the Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) and described trends, sociodemographic, geographic distribution, and clinical outcomes. We compared cases, positivity, and clinical outcomes in the period January 2018 to December 2021. Results We found Lassa fever to be reported throughout the year with more than half the cases reported within the first quarter of the year, a recent increase in numbers and geographic spread of the virus, and male and adult (&gt;18 years) preponderance. Case fatality rates were worse in males, the under-five and elderly, during off-peak periods, and among low reporting states. Conclusion Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria with a recent increase in numbers and geographical distribution. Sustaining improved surveillance, enhanced laboratory diagnosis and improved case management capacity during off-peak periods should remain a priority.

Egoh; Nnenna Udensi,Therapeutic Advances in Infectious Disease,2021.0,"Introduction: Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever with non-specific symptoms that has shown an upward trend in Nigeria and other West African countries, which is depicted by high incidence and case fatality in recent years. There are different reports on the yearly case burden of Lassa fever from the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria, through the regulatory body – Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Being the epicentre of the disease, Lassa fever has been exported from Nigeria to both neighbouring and distant countries.Methods: The aim of this review was to carry out a retrospective analysis from January 2015 to 26 September 2021 of the weekly and yearly outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria based on selected publications. The focus was on timely diagnosis, treatment option, public health interventions and progress of clinical trials for vaccine candidates, and to identify proactive measures that can be sustained to curb periodic outbreaks. The review was done using percentages, cross-tabulation and graphical charts. Results: The predominant age group infected was 21 to 40 years with a male to female ratio of 1:0.8. A total of 3311 laboratory-confirmed Lassa fever cases out of 20,588 suspected cases were identified from 29 states. Edo, Ondo, Taraba, Ebonyi, Bauchi, Plateau and Nasarawa had yearly Lassa fever incidence over the time frame considered. Contact tracing was done on over 33,804 individuals with about 90% completing follow-up. Case fatality rate within the period ranged from 9.3% to 29.2%. There is a sharp decline in the epidemiological trend of Lassa fever in the yearly seasonal peaks from weeks 1 to 13 with about 75% reduction in incidence between 2020 and 2021. Conclusion: The effective management of Lassa fever needs the implementation of preventive methods, prompt laboratory diagnosis, timely treatment, provision of personal protective equipment, cross-border surveillance, contact tracing, community awareness and vector control in order to minimise spread.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868582/,https://openalex.org/W3216622282,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/PMID_34868582.pdf,2026-01-26T01:40:40+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#3634,True

Wood,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2016.0,"A considerable amount of disease is transmitted from animals to humans and many of these zoonoses are neglected tropical diseases. As outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza and Ebola have demonstrated, however, zoonotic diseases are serious threats to global public health and are not just problems confined to remote regions. There are two fundamental, and poorly studied, stages of zoonotic disease emergence: 'spillover', i.e. transmission of pathogens from animals to humans, and 'stuttering transmission', i.e. when limited human-to-human infections occur, leading to self-limiting chains of transmission. We developed a transparent, theoretical framework, based on a generalization of Poisson processes with memory of past human infections, that unifies these stages. Once we have quantified pathogen dynamics in the reservoir, with some knowledge of the mechanism of contact, the approach provides a tool to estimate the likelihood of spillover events. Comparisons with independent agent-based models demonstrates the ability of the framework to correctly estimate the relative contributions of human-to-human vs animal transmission. As an illustrative example, we applied our model to Lassa fever, a rodent-borne, viral haemorrhagic disease common in West Africa, for which data on human outbreaks were available. The approach developed here is general and applicable to a range of zoonoses. This kind of methodology is of crucial importance for the scientific, medical and public health communities working at the interface between animal and human diseases to assess the risk associated with the disease and to plan intervention and appropriate control measures.

We analyzed the model and carried out numerical simulations to determine the impact of each transmission routes. Our results showed that the burden of Lassa fever infection is increased when all the transmission routes are incorporated and most single transmission routes are less harmful, but when in combination with other transmission routes, they increase the Lassa fever burden.

The rodent Mastomys natalensis serves as the primary reservoir and its ecology and behaviour have been linked to the distinct spatial and temporal patterns in the incidence of Lf. Nigeria has experienced an unprecedented epidemic that lasted from January until April of 2018, which has been followed by subsequent epidemics of Lf in the same period every year since. While previous research has modelled the case seasonality within Nigeria, this did not capture the seasonal variation in the reproduction of the zoonotic reservoir and its effect on case numbers. To this end, we introduce an approximate Bayesian computation scheme to fit our model to the case data from 2018–2020 supplied by the NCDC. In this study we used a periodically forced seasonal nonautonomous system of ordinary differential equations as a vector model to demonstrate that the population dynamics of the rodent reservoir may be responsible for the spikes in the number of observed cases in humans. The results show that in December through to March, spillover from the zoonotic reservoir drastically increases and spreads the virus to the people of Nigeria.

The Qualitative analyses we have conveyed on this model using well established methods viz: Cauchy’s differential theorem, Birkhoff &amp; Rota’s theorem verifies and reveals the well-posedness, and carrying capacity of the model respectively. We established that a LHF-free equilibrium termed the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) exists for this model and this equilibrium however from our stability analyses, tends to be stable when the basic reproduction number computed via next generation matrix method is less than unity (one); and unstable if otherwise. Furthermore, we have carried out a sensitivity analyses to check variation effects of the model parameters when increased or decreased using the normalized forward-sensitivity index; unraveling the most sensitive parameters which requires the attention of the healthcare workers as; the effective contact rates W, and the rodents’ recruitment rate e. After which numerical simulations of the model were carried out to verify our qualitative analyses (Stability and sensitivity analysis) and to study the dynamical behavior of the model; showing that the presence of saturation instantaneously causes the system to approach a DFE/LHF-Free equilibrium.From these qualitative analyses and numerical simulation results, we recommend early intervention and early treatment of Lassa haemorrhagic virus infection (LAHV) with Ribavirin on the infected, maximum hygiene practices and periodic evacuation of rodents in households in order to curb the recruitment of wild/rodents.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-33293/v1,https://openalex.org/W4244733030,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/DOI_a8a794959220.pdf,2026-01-26T01:40:46+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#4316,True

The diverse LASV strains are grouped into six major lineages based on the geographical location of the isolated strains. In this study, we have focused on the lineage II strains from southern Nigeria. We determined the viral sequences from positive cases of LF reported at tertiary hospitals in Ebonyi and Enugu between 2012 and 2016. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that 29 out of 123 suspected cases were positive for the virus among which 11 viral gene sequences were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete coding sequences of the four viral proteins revealed that lineage II strains are broadly divided into two genetic clades that diverged from a common ancestor 195 years ago. One clade, consisting of strains from Ebonyi and Enugu, was more conserved than the other from Irrua, although the four viral proteins were evolving at similar rates in both clades.

A deterministic model was formulated to quantify the transmission dynamics of the disease under isolation and treatment of the isolated asymptomatic and symptomatic humans for effective management and possible elimination of the disease. The solutions of the model were shown to be positive and bounded. Equilibrium analysis was conducted and both the disease-free and the endemic equilibria were derived. The threshold quantity for disease elimination , $R_{0}$ , was also obtained and used to derive conditions for the existence of stability of the eqilibria. The quantity was also employed to examine the sensitivity of the model parameters to disease propagation and reduction. The theoretical analysis was then complemented with the quantitative analysis by adopting a set of realistic values for the model parameters in order to show the effect of isolation and treatment on the spread and fatality of Lassa fever. Results from the quantitative study showed that death and infection from Lassa fever fell continuously as more and more exposed individuals were detected and isolated for treatment.

Elagan,Scientific Reports,2023.0,"Abstract Lassa fever is a hemorrhagic virus infection that is usually spread by rodents. It is a fatal infection that is prevalent in certain West African countries. We created an analytical deterministic-stochastic framework for the epidemics of Lassa fever employing a collection of ordinary differential equations with nonlinear solutions to identify the influence of propagation processes on infected development in individuals and rodents, which include channels that are commonly overlooked, such as ecological emergent and aerosol pathways. The findings shed light on the role of both immediate and subsequent infectiousness via the power law, exponential decay and generalized Mittag-Leffler kernels. The scenario involves the presence of a steady state and an endemic equilibrium regardless of the fundamental reproduction number, $$\Re _{0}&lt;1$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>ℜ</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> </mml:msub> <mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> , making Lassa fever influence challenging and dependent on the severity of the initial sub-populations. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the stochastic structure has an exclusive global positive solution via a positive starting point. The stochastic Lyapunov candidate approach is subsequently employed to determine sufficient requirements for the existence and uniqueness of an ergodic stationary distribution of non-negative stochastic simulation approaches.

Ultimately, modeling techniques are used to verify the mathematical conclusions. Our fractional and stochastic findings exhibit that when all modes of transmission are included, the impact of Lassa fever disease increases.

Schieffelin,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2023.0,"Background Lassa virus (LASV), the cause of the acute viral hemorrhagic illness Lassa fever (LF), is endemic in West Africa. Infections in humans occur mainly after exposure to infected excrement or urine of the rodent-host, Mastomys natalensis . The prevalence of exposure to LASV in Sierra Leone is crudely estimated and largely unknown. This cross-sectional study aimed to establish a baseline point seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to LASV in three administrative districts of Sierra Leone and identify potential risk factors for seropositivity and LASV exposure. Methodology and principal findings Between 2015 and 2018, over 10,642 participants from Kenema, Tonkolili, and Port Loko Districts were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Previous LASV and LF epidemiological studies support classification of these districts as “endemic,” “emerging,” and “non-endemic”, respectively. Dried blood spot samples were tested for LASV antibodies by ELISA to determine the seropositivity of participants, indicating previous exposure to LASV. Surveys were administered to each participant to assess demographic and environmental factors associated with a higher risk of exposure to LASV. Overall seroprevalence for antibodies to LASV was 16.0%. In Kenema, Port Loko, and Tonkolili Districts, seroprevalences were 20.1%, 14.1%, and 10.6%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, individuals were more likely to be LASV seropositive if they were living in Kenema District, regardless of sex, age, or occupation. Environmental factors contributed to an increased risk of LASV exposure, including poor housing construction and proximity to bushland, forested areas, and refuse. Conclusions and significance In this study we determine a baseline LASV seroprevalence in three districts which will inform future epidemiological, ecological, and clinical studies on LF and the LASV in Sierra Leone. The heterogeneity of the distribution of LASV and LF over both space, and time, can make the design of efficacy trials and intervention programs difficult. Having more studies on the prevalence of LASV and identifying potential hyper-endemic areas will greatly increase the awareness of LF and improve targeted control programs related to LASV.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36758101/,https://openalex.org/W4319662798,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/PMID_36758101.pdf,2026-01-26T01:40:58+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#2772,True

Fetterer; Nadia Wauquier; Moinya Coomber; James Bangura; Joseph N. Fair; Jean‐Paul Gonzalez; Randal J. Schoepp,Virology Journal,2016.0,"Sub-Saharan Africa is home to a variety of pathogens, but disease surveillance and the healthcare infrastructure necessary for proper management and control are severely limited. Lassa virus, the cause of Lassa fever, a severe hemorrhagic fever in humans is endemic in West Africa. In Sierra Leone at the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory, up to 70 % of acute patient samples suspected of Lassa fever test negative for Lassa virus infection. This large amount of acute undiagnosed febrile illness can be attributed in part to an array of hemorrhagic fever and arthropod-borne viruses causing disease that goes undetected and untreated. To better define the nature and extent of viral pathogens infecting the Sierra Leonean population, we developed a multiplexed MAGPIX® assay to detect IgG antibodies against Lassa, Ebola, Marburg, Rift Valley fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses as well as pan-assays for flaviviruses and alphaviruses. This assay was used to survey 675 human serum samples submitted to the Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory between 2007 and 2014. In the study population, 50.2 % were positive for Lassa virus, 5.2 % for Ebola virus, 10.7 % for Marburg virus, 1.8 % for Rift Valley fever virus, 2.0 % for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, 52.9 % for flaviviruses and 55.8 % for alphaviruses. These data exemplify the importance of disease surveillance and differential diagnosis for viral diseases in Sierra Leone. We demonstrate the endemic nature of some of these viral pathogens in the region and suggest that unrecognized outbreaks of viral infection have occurred.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0621-4,https://openalex.org/W2410531632,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/DOI_af2f2ff75814.pdf,2026-01-26T01:41:02+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#466,True

However, coordination using an incident management system (IMS) in line with a One Health approach involving human, environment, and animal health with collaborations between government and non-governmental agencies result in improved response outcome for zoonotic diseases such as Lassa fever (LF). We provide an overview of the 2019 LF outbreak response in Nigeria using the IMS and One Health approach. The response was coordinated via ten Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) response pillars. Cardinal response activities included activation of EOC, development of an incident action plan, deployment of One Health rapid response teams to support affected states, mid-outbreak review and after-action review meetings. Between 1st January and 29th December 2019, of the 5057 people tested for LF, 833 were confirmed positive from 23 States, across 86 Local Government Areas. Of the 833 confirmed cases, 650 (78%) were from hotspot States of Edo (36%), Ondo (26%) and Ebonyi (16%). Those in the age-group 21-40 years (47%) were mostly affected, with a male to female ratio of 1:1. Twenty healthcare workers were affected. Two LF naïve states Kebbi and Zamfara, reported confirmed cases for the first time during this period. The outbreak peaked earlier in the year compared to previous years, and the emergency phase of the outbreak was declared over by epidemiological week 17 based on low national threshold composite indicators over a period of six consecutive weeks. Multisectoral and multidisciplinary strategic One Health EOC coordination at all levels facilitated the swift containment of Nigeria's large LF outbreak in 2019. It is therefore imperative to embrace One Health approach embedded within the EOC to holistically address the increasing LF incidence in Nigeria.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34820499/,https://openalex.org/W3212995731,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/PMID_34820499.pdf,2026-01-26T01:41:06+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#3635,True

Garry,PLoS ONE,2019.0,"Situated in southeastern Sierra Leone, Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) maintains one of the world's only Lassa fever isolation wards and was a strategic Ebola virus disease (EVD) treatment facility during the 2014 EVD outbreak. Since 2006, the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC) has carried out research activities at KGH, capturing clinical and laboratory data for suspected cases of Lassa fever. Here we describe the approach, progress, and challenges in designing and maintaining a data capture and management system (DCMS) at KGH to assist infectious disease researchers in building and sustaining DCMS in low-resource environments. Results on screening patterns and case-fatality rates are provided to illustrate the context and scope of the DCMS covered in this study. A medical records system and DCMS was designed and implemented between 2010 and 2016 linking historical and prospective Lassa fever data sources across KGH Lassa fever units and its peripheral health units. Data were captured using a case report form (CRF) system, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate readers, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines, blood chemistry analyzers, and data auditing procedures. Between 2008 and 2016, blood samples for 4,229 suspected Lassa fever cases were screened at KGH, ranging from 219 samples in 2008 to a peak of 760 samples in 2011. Lassa fever case-fatality rates before and following the Ebola outbreak were 65.5% (148/226) and 89.5% (17/19), respectively, suggesting that fewer, but more seriously ill subjects with Lassa fever presented to KGH following the 2014 EVD outbreak (p = .040). DCMS challenges included weak specificity of the Lassa fever suspected case definition, limited capture of patient survival outcome data, internet costs, lapses in internet connectivity, low bandwidth, equipment and software maintenance, lack of computer teaching laboratories, and workload fluctuations due to variable screening activity. DCMS are the backbone of international research efforts and additional literature is needed on the topic for establishing benchmarks and driving goal-based approaches for its advancement in developing countries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30921383/,https://openalex.org/W2934712772,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/PMID_30921383.pdf,2026-01-26T01:41:07+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#2636,True

Grant,Microorganisms,2021.0,"Lassa fever (LF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease found in Sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for up to 300,000 cases and 5000 deaths annually. LF is highly endemic in Sierra Leone, particularly in its Eastern Province. Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) maintains one of only a few LF isolation facilities in the world with year-round diagnostic testing. Here we focus on space-time trends for LF occurring in Sierra Leone between 2012 and 2019 to provide a current account of LF in the wake of the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic. Data were analyzed for 3277 suspected LF cases and classified as acute, recent, and non-LF or prior LF exposure using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Presentation rates for acute, recent, and non-LF or prior LF exposure were 6.0% (195/3277), 25.6% (838/3277), and 68.4% (2244/3277), respectively. Among 2051 non-LF or prior LF exposures, 33.2% (682/2051) tested positive for convalescent LF exposure. The overall LF case-fatality rate (CFR) was 78.5% (106/135). Both clinical presentations and confirmed LF cases declined following the Ebola epidemic. These declines coincided with an increased duration between illness onset and clinical presentation, perhaps suggesting more severe disease or presentation at later stages of illness. Acute LF cases and their corresponding CFRs peaked during the dry season (November to April). Subjects with recent (but not acute) LF exposure were more likely to present during the rainy season (May to October) than the dry season (p &lt; 0.001). The findings here suggest that LF remains endemic in Sierra Leone and that caseloads are likely to resume at levels observed prior to the Ebola epidemic. The results provide insight on the current epidemiological profile of LF in Sierra Leone to facilitate LF vaccine studies and accentuate the need for LF cohort studies and continued advancements in LF diagnostics.",https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9030586,https://openalex.org/W3136946789,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/DOI_207eed7c277d.pdf,2026-01-26T01:41:20+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#3530,True

We identify 13 distinct viruses, including the second and third documented cases of human blood-associated dicistrovirus, and a highly divergent, unclassified dicistrovirus that we name human blood-associated dicistrovirus 2. We show that pegivirus C is a common co-infection in individuals with LF and is associated with lower Lassa viral loads and favorable outcomes. We help uncover the causes of three outbreaks as yellow fever virus, monkeypox virus, and a noninfectious cause, the latter ultimately determined to be pesticide poisoning.

In Africa, the burden of rodent-borne diseases is not well described. To investigate human seroprevalence of selected rodent-borne pathogens, sera from 657 healthy adults in ten rural communities in Ghana were analyzed. An in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to Lassa virus was positive in 34 (5%) of the human samples. Using commercial kits, antibodies to hantavirus serotypes, Puumala and Dobrava, and Leptospira bacteria were detected in 11%, 12% and 21% of the human samples, respectively. Forty percent of residents in rural farming communities in Ghana have measurable antibodies to at least one of the rodent-borne pathogens tested, including antibodies to viral hemorrhagic fever viruses.

Grant; Zainab Kanneh; Brima Jusu; Joseph Edem-Hotah; Lansana Kanneh; Foday Alhasan; Michael Gbakie; John S. Schieffelin; Samreen Ijaz; Richard S. Tedder; Hilary Bower,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2021.0,"Background Despite identification 50 years ago, the true burden of Lassa Fever (LF) across Africa remains undefined for reasons including research focus on hospitalised patients, lack of validated field-feasible tools which reliably identify past infection, and the fact that all assays require blood samples making large-scale surveys difficult. Designated a priority pathogen of epidemic potential requiring urgent research by the World Health Organisation, a better understanding of LF sero-epidemiology is essential to developing and evaluating new interventions including vaccines. We describe the first field testing of a novel species-neutral Double Antigen Binding Assay (DABA) designed to detect antibodies to LF in plasma and oral fluid. Methodology/Principal findings Paired plasma and oral fluid were collected in Sierra Leone from survivors discharged from Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Fever Unit between 1980 and 2018, and from controls recruited in Freetown in 2019. Epidemiological sensitivity and specificity of the DABA measured against historical diagnosis in survivors and self-declared non-exposed controls was 81.7% (95% CI 70.7%– 89.9%) and 83.3% (72.7%- 91.1%) respectively in plasma, and 71.8% (60.0%– 81.9%) and 83.3% (72.7%– 91.1%) respectively in oral fluid. Antibodies were identified in people infected up to 15 years and, in one case, 40 years previously. Participants found oral fluid collection easy and painless with 80% happy to give an oral fluid sample regularly. Conclusions/Significance Given the difficulties of assay validation in a resource-limited setting, including unexpected exposures and diagnostics of varying accuracy, the new assay performed well in both plasma and oral fluid. Sensitivity and specificity are expected to be higher when case/control ascertainment is more definitive and further work is planned to investigate this. Even at the performance levels achieved, the species-neutral DABA has the potential to facilitate the large-scale seroprevalence surveys needed to underpin essential developments in LF control, as well as support zoonotic investigations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33788861/,https://openalex.org/W3143660864,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/PMID_33788861.pdf,2026-01-26T01:45:24+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#2679,True

Such evidence would facilitate the design of therapeutic and vaccine trials and the design of control programs. Our study sought to address some of these gaps by estimating the seroprevalence and seroconversion risk of Lassa fever in pregnant women. Methodology/Principal findings We conducted a prospective hospital-based cohort between February and December 2019 in Edo State, Southern Nigeria, enrolling pregnant women at antenatal clinic and following them up at delivery. Samples were evaluated for IgG antibodies against Lassa virus. The study demonstrates a seroprevalence of Lassa IgG antibodies of 49.6% and a seroconversion risk of 20.8%. Seropositivity was strongly correlated with rodent exposure around homes with an attributable risk proportion of 35%. Seroreversion was also seen with a seroreversion risk of 13.4%. Conclusions/Significance Our study suggests that 50% of pregnant women were at risk of Lassa infection and that 35.0% of infections might be preventable by avoiding rodent exposure and conditions which facilitate infestation and the risk of human-rodent contact. While the evidence on rodent exposure is subjective and further studies are needed to provide a better understanding of the avenues of human-rodent interaction; public health measures to decrease the risk of rodent infestation and the risk of spill over events may be beneficial. With an estimated seroconversion risk of 20.8%, our study suggests an appreciable risk of contracting Lassa fever during pregnancy and while most of these seroconversions may not be new infections, given the high risk of adverse outcomes in pregnancy, it supports the need for preventative and therapeutic options against Lassa fever in pregnancy. The occurrence of seroreversion in our study suggests that the prevalence obtained in this, and other cohorts may be an underestimate of the actual proportion of women of childbearing age who present at pregnancy with prior LASV exposure. Additionally, the occurrence of both seroconversion and seroreversion in this cohort suggests that these parameters would need to be considered for the development of Lassa vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, and utility models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37216412/,https://openalex.org/W4377225022,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/PMID_37216412.pdf,2026-01-26T01:45:55+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#2739,True

For instance, mathematical modeling, computer graphics, camera, operating system, Java, disk encryption, web, streaming, and many more are the applications of real-world problems. In this case, we consider disease modeling and its computational treatment. Computational approximations have a significant role in different sciences such as behavioral, social, physical, and biological sciences. But the well-known techniques that are widely used in the literature have many problems. These methods are not consistent with the physical nature and even violate the actual behavior of the continuous model. The structural properties needed for such disciplines, as dynamical consistency, positivity, and boundedness, are the critical requirements of the models in these fields. We studied the transmission of Lassa fever dynamically and numerically. The model’s positivity, boundedness, reproduction number, equilibria, and local stability are investigated in dynamical analysis. In numerical analysis, we developed some explicit and implicit methods. Unfortunately, explicit methods like Euler and Runge Kutta are time-dependent and violate the physical properties of the disease. Then, the proposed implicit method for the said model, the non-standard finite difference, is independent of the time step, dynamically consistent, positive, and bounded.

With rejuvenated interest in LF and a call for accelerated research on the Lassa virus (LASV) vaccine, there is a need to define the correlates of natural protective immune responses to LF. Here, we describe cellular and antibody immune responses present in survivors of LF (N = 370) and their exposed contacts (N = 170) in a LASV endemic region in Nigeria. Interestingly, our data showed comparable T cell and binding antibody responses from both survivors and their contacts, while neutralizing antibody responses were primarily seen in the LF survivors and not their contacts. Neutralizing antibody responses were found to be cross-reactive against all five lineages of LASV with a strong bias to Lineage II, the prevalent strain in southern Nigeria. We demonstrated that both T cell and antibody responses were not detectable in peripheral blood after a decade in LF survivors. Notably LF survivors maintained high levels of detectable binding antibody response for six months while their contacts did not.

This increase has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite increasing focus on the disease by both local and international scientists. Many of these studies on LF have been limited to few specialised centres in the country. This study was done to identify sociodemographic and clinical predictors of LF disease and related deaths across Nigeria. We analysed retrospective surveillance data on suspected LF cases collected during January-June 2018 and 2019. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors independently associated with laboratory–confirmed LF diagnosis, and with LF–related deaths. There were confirmed 815 of 1991 suspected LF cases with complete records during this period. Of these, 724/815 confirmed cases had known clinical outcomes, of whom 100 died. LF confirmation was associated with presentation of gastrointestinal tract (aOR 3.47, 95% CI: 2.79–4.32), ear, nose and throat (aOR 2.73, 95% CI: 1.80–4.15), general systemic (aOR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.65–2.70) and chest/respiratory (aOR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.28–2.29) symptoms. Other factors were being male (aOR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.06–1.63), doing business/trading (aOR 2.16, 95% CI: 1.47–3.16) and farming (aOR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.12–2.68). Factors associated with LF mortality were a one-year increase in age (aOR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04), bleeding (aOR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.07–4.00), and central nervous manifestations (aOR 5.02, 95% CI: 3.12–10.16). Diverse factors were associated with both LF disease and related death. A closer look at patterns of clinical variables would be helpful to support early detection and management of cases. The findings would also be useful for planning preparedness and response interventions against LF in the country and region.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36962735/,https://openalex.org/W4293150110,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/PMID_36962735.pdf,2026-01-26T02:40:52+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#3991,True

While there have been remarkable innovations in vaccine development, with some Lassa vaccines undergoing early clinical trials. An understanding of Lassa antibody kinetics and immune responses will support vaccine design and development. However, there is currently no evidence on the antibody kinetics of Lassa (LASV) in pregnancy. Our study sought to estimate the efficiency of transplacental transfer of LASV IgG antibodies from the mother to the child. Methodology/Principal findings The study made use of data from a prospective hospital-based cohort of pregnant women enrolled at the antenatal clinic and followed up at delivery between February and December 2019. Blood samples from mother-child pairs were evaluated for antibodies against Lassa virus. The study demonstrates a transplacental transfer of LASV IgG of 75.3% [60.0–94.0%], with a significant positive correlation between maternal and cord concentrations and a good level of agreement. The study also suggests that transfer may be more variable in women with ‘ de novo’ antibodies compared to those with pre-existing antibodies. Conclusions/Significance The study shows that maternal antibody levels play an important role in determining transfer efficiency of Lassa antibodies to the new-born; and while the evidence is preliminary, the study also suggests that transfer efficiency may be less stable in acute or recent infection, as such timing of vaccination before pregnancy, that is in women of childbearing age may be more appropriate for protection of both pregnant women and their neonates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37053304/,https://openalex.org/W4365457085,,lassa,"Lassa AND ((transmission OR transmissibility OR transmissible OR transmitted OR transmitting OR transmit OR epidemiology OR epidemiological OR epidemiologic) OR (model OR models OR modeling OR modelling OR modeled OR modelled NOT (image OR images OR imaging)) OR (severity OR ""case fatality ratio"" OR ""case fatality ratios"" OR CFR OR ""case fatality rate"" OR ""case fatality rates"" OR ""mortality rate"" OR ""mortality rates"" OR ""attack rate"" OR ""attack rates"") OR (""infectious period"" OR ""infectious periods"" OR ""serial interval"" OR ""serial intervals"" OR ""incubation period"" OR ""incubation periods"" OR ""generation time"" OR ""generation interval"" OR ""generation intervals"" OR ""latent period"" OR ""latent periods"" OR latency) OR (heterogeneity OR heterogeneous OR superspread OR superspreader OR superspreaders OR superspreading OR ""super spread"" OR ""super spreader"" OR ""super spreaders"" OR ""super spreading"" OR overdispersion OR overdispersed OR ""over dispersion"" OR ""over dispersed"") OR (infectivity OR infectiousness OR ""growth rate"" OR ""growth rates"" OR ""reproduction number"" OR ""reproduction numbers"" OR ""reproductive number"" OR ""reproductive numbers"" OR R0 OR ""reproduction ratio"" OR ""reproduction ratios"" OR ""reproductive rate"" OR ""reproductive rates"" OR ""basic reproduction number"") OR (""pre-existing immunity"" OR serological OR serology OR serosurvey OR serosurveys OR seroprevalence OR serosurveillance) OR (evolution OR evolutionary OR evolving OR evolved OR mutation OR mutations OR mutant OR mutants OR mutate OR mutated OR substitution OR substitutions) OR (outbreak OR outbreaks OR cluster OR clusters OR clustering OR epidemic OR epidemics OR pandemic OR pandemics) OR (""risk factor"" OR ""risk factors""))",2026-01-26T01:37:49+00:00,True,data/pipeline/lassa/harvests/pdfs/PMID_37053304.pdf,2026-01-26T04:25:31+00:00,Europe_PMC_Fulltext,,INCLUDE,INCLUDE,#2826,True

Infectious diseases,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Lassa fever is endemic in several west African countries. Case-fatality rates ranging from 21% to 69% have been reported. The pathophysiology of the disease in humans and determinants of mortality remain poorly understood. We aimed to determine host protein biomarkers capable of determining disease outcome.
METHODS: In this observational study, we analysed left-over blood samples from patients who tested positive for Lassa fever at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, between January, 2014, and April, 2017. We measured viral load, concentrations of clinical chemistry parameters, and levels of 62 circulating proteins involved in inflammation, immune response, and haemostasis. Patients with a known outcome (survival or death) and at least 200 μL of good-quality diagnostic sample were included in logistic regression modelling to assess the correlation of parameters with Lassa fever outcome. Individuals who gave consent could further be enrolled into a longitudinal analysis to assess the association of parameters with Lassa fever outcome over time. Participants were divided into two datasets for the statistical analysis: a primary dataset (samples taken between Jan 1, 2014, and April 1, 2016), and a secondary dataset (samples taken between April 1, 2016, and April 1, 2017). Biomarkers were ranked by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from highest (most predictive) to lowest (least predictive).
FINDINGS: Of 554 patients who tested positive for Lassa fever during the study period, 201 (131 in the primary dataset and 70 in the secondary dataset) were included in the biomarker analysis, of whom 74 (49 in the primary dataset and 25 in the secondary dataset) had died and 127 (82 in the primary dataset and 45 in the secondary dataset) had survived. Cycle threshold values (indicating viral load) and levels of 18 host proteins at the time of admission to hospital were significantly correlated with fatal outcome. The best predictors of outcome in both datasets were plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; AUC 0·878 in the primary dataset and 0·876 in the secondary dataset), soluble thrombomodulin (TM; 0·839 in the primary dataset and 0·875 in the secondary dataset), and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNF-R1; 0·807 in the primary dataset and 0·851 in the secondary dataset), all of which had higher prediction accuracy than viral load (0·774 in the primary dataset and 0·837 in the secondary dataset). Longitudinal analysis (150 patients, of whom 36 died) showed that of the biomarkers that were predictive at admission, PAI-1 levels consistently decreased to normal levels in survivors but not in those who died.
INTERPRETATION: The identification of PAI-1 and soluble TM as markers of fatal Lassa fever at admission, and of PAI-1 as a marker of fatal Lassa fever over time, suggests that dysregulated coagulation and fibrinolysis and endothelial damage have roles in the pathophysiology of Lassa fever, providing a mechanistic explanation for the association of Lassa fever with oedema and bleeding. These novel markers might aid in clinical risk stratification and disease monitoring.
