      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges have emerged as an important component within the post-training pipeline. The growing popularity of judge LLMs has prompted their evaluation on proxy alignment and reward modelling datasets. Yet, they have not been assessed under combined cross-lingual and multimodal settings. To address this gap, we introduce PolyVis (Polyglot Vision-Language Alignment), a multilingual vision-language alignment benchmark that evaluates judge models under 12 languages and distinct task objectives: hallucinations, safety, knowledge and reasoning. Our findings reveal LLM judge model performance is significantly influenced by composite interactions between task objectives, language and individual model characteristics. These results suggest the need for building tailored evaluation frameworks to challenge each model’s specific capabilities, moving beyond one-size-fits-all approaches that obscure critical performance disparities.",

      "abstract": "LLM self-explanations are often presented as a promising tool for AI oversight, yet their faithfulness to the model's true reasoning process is poorly understood. Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior.",
