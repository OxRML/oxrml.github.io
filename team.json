      "longBio": "Jessica is studying part-time for a DPhil in Social Data Science. Her research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Scientific AI, and Metascience. Through her project Flowmetrics, she proposes a new generation of research metrics that conceptualise societal impact as a dynamic semantic flow—traced and modelled using large language models and knowledge graphs.\n\nFlowmetrics builds on the lineage of bibliometrics, scientometrics, webometrics, and altmetrics, but for the first time introduces AI-driven techniques to infer how research disseminates, engages audiences, and produces real-world outcomes. Using NLP methods and structured ontologies, the project extracts and classifies signals of impact across platforms and represents them as evolving trajectories within a knowledge graph.\n\nAlongside her research, Jessica works full-time for Springer Nature as a Lead Data Scientist, where she develops machine learning systems for peer review, research integrity, and editorial decision support. She has also worked across a range of industries in data science roles and holds an MSc in Computer Science with a research focus on Machine Learning and NLP.",
